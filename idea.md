# 105th Combined Arms Organizational Doctrine

Keeping an operation organized is vital for its success but becomes difficult when in-game squads grow above 10. Moreover, its common for players to become disorganized and attack/defend piecemeal instead of as a group. Therefor, I propose this organizational structure that keeps small groups of soldiers focused on specific tasks and improves operational and logistical efficiency. Squads and platoons make up the main functional units.

## Squads
The basic unit of organization is the squad, which is of a smaller size than the in-game squad. Squads can range in size from three to six people depending on equipment and function. Here are some example squads:
 

### Rifle Squad

    - Size: 3-6 people
    - Role: basic tactical element that can eliminate enemy presence in an area, defensively or offensively
    - Positions
        - Squad Leader (NCO) [catena or dusk, binos, radio]: organizes the movements of the squad
        - Grenadier (Enlisted) [lunaire, tremola, gas, smoke]: eliminate pillbox, area denial with gas, cover with smoke
        - heavy rifleman (Enlisted) [catara, gast, lionclaw]: main source of firepower, useful for suppression
        - rifleman 2x (Enlisted/conscript) [argenti, bombastones, shovel]: 
        - AT Rifleman (Enlisted) [lightweight rifle, ignis, stickies, or venom]

    - Orders:
        - Advance: assault and objective using fire and manuever or gas on entreched enemies
        - Defend: Set up engagement areas, small fortifications, and a forward observation post.
        - Screen: provide infantry support for another squad (tank squad)

### Tank Squad

    - Size: 1-2 tanks, 3-6 people, but largely depends on types of tanks
    - Role: Tank combat, PVE support, or anti-infantry depending on tanks equipped
    - Positions:
        - Squad Leader (NCO): commander position in one of the tanks
        - driver 2x (Enlisted):
        - gunner 2-4 (Enlisted):
        - misc operator 0-2 (Conscript): i.e. talos engineer

    - Orders:
        - Combat Tanks: Tank warefare, in a tank line or in a flank
        - Destroy Structures: Eliminate an enemy structure
        - Support Infantry: use MG-equipped tanks to enhance infantry squad's fire power


### Other Squads:

- Weapons squad (2-3):
    - tower/truck driver/ammo bearer (Enlisted)
    - gunner (Enlisted)
    - Crew/driver (Conscript)

- engineering squad (bunker and frontline loadouts)
    - planner
    - engineers x3

- hydra squad
    - hydra leader (grenadier)
    - hydra bearer (5x)

- 120 artillery squad
    - operator 3x
    - ammo bearer 3x

- rocket squadron
    - operator 6x

## Platoon
Platoons are groupings of squads, up to 4 squads, which can all be contained within one in-game squad for communication. Platoons have a headquaters, which helps with the need of overall administrative support.

### Platoon HQ 
    - Platoon Leader (Officer) [radio, binos, argonaut]: Coordinates and gives orders to squads
    - medic (Enlisted): Optional, used if infantry squads are present
    - spotter (Enlisted): Optional, used if platoon contains artillery squads
    - logi 2x (Enlisted): Provides logistical support during operations, such as peparing rocket staging area or delivering ammo and shirts to bunker bases. For logistic intensive squads, such as an artillery squad, organic logistic support is expected.

## Simplified Frontline Logistics:

Because each squad has a dedicated role, the types of squads for an operation can be expected along with the equipment for each squad. Bunker stockpiles can be automatically tracked, and when a certain squad's equipment is running low, platoon logistics soldiers can make a trip to the stockpile. **Bunker and storage depots stockpiles can be measured in squad-hours to better orient logistical goals with operational goals.** For example, we have two tanks in stockpile and 3 crates of 40mm ammo, meaning we have 1 squad-hour of resources for a tank squad. This also facilitates operation planning, letting platoon leaders and higher ups know their available combat power rapidly.

## Larger groupings:

It is rare that there are enough people online to fill more than one platoon, but in that case, a larger HQ can be formed over the platoons at a company level. Companies would be anywhere from 30-60 players, where 60 players is half the maximum population of a hex. In that context, companies are the largest unit of delpoyment that should be allotted to a hex. Companies could also house different, more specialized squads that could move around platoon to platoon to support their objectives. For example, a mortar half-track squad shelling a BB with incindiary when an assaulting platoon advances enough.

In my opinion, for our regiment, organizational levels higher than company better serve as an administrative organization outside of operations, where we have different battallions for different types of labor in foxhole (Combat, logistics, facilities, engineering) I.E. Logistics battallion. Each battalion combines to make a Regiment.

## Conclusion
This was just a series of fun thoughts I had while watching different youtube videos on military units, and while there are a lot of good logical advantages that could be had with this system, actually implementing them is very difficult in the far from perfect universe of foxhole. I hope you enjoyed my LARP as much as I did. Please share your thoughts on how foxhole regiments could be structured similarly to the real world.
